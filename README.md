<h1>Hazaa - Raspberry PI BOX 

<h2>Description</h2>
This was my IoT class project, the idea was to build a mini cyberdeck without a screen or a keyboard so you can take it anywhere, it uses Arduino & Raspberry PI 4 4GB. I'm trying to setup it up to monitor network traffic and detect any malicious packets that comes in, if ever. This idea is still a work in progress.
